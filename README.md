# Patient Registration

This is an implementation of a patient registration system, which consists of two classes: `Patient` and `HospitalManager`. The `Patient` class represents a patient with a name and a status (Normal, Urgent, or Super Urgent). The `HospitalManager` class manages a list of patients, separated by specializations, with methods to add/remove patients, get the next patient, and get printable information about patients. The `FrontendManager` class is the frontend for interacting with the user, presenting a menu and calling the appropriate methods from the `HospitalManager` class.

The project was built using Python programming language.
